# UAG: Uncertainty-aware Adaptive Guidance

## Overview

This repository is the official implementation of the paper "Reasoning in Flux: Enhancing Large Language Models Reasoning through Uncertainty-aware Adaptive Guidance". Our work focuses on improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models by integrating uncertainty-aware mechanisms that adaptively guide the reasoning process. This approach helps models manage and leverage uncertainty in data-driven scenarios, enhancing their decision-making and reasoning skills.

## Code Release

We are currently in the process of organizing and finalizing the code associated with our research. The complete source code will be made publicly available on this repository soon. Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for your interest in our work!
